pm7_charge_results has the files necessary for plotting the HOMO-HOMO energy differences

pm7_charge_calculation has the files with pm7 partial charges calculations (not being used for plotting, but were calculated)


run GPT_modification_just_plots.ipynb for plotting. The drive needs not be mounted (that was included as I had the data stored there)
